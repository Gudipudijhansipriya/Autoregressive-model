# Autoregressive-model
An autoregressive (AR) model predicts future behavior based on past behavior. It’s used for forecasting when there is some correlation between values in a time series and the values that precede and succeed them.
In an AR model, the value of the outcome variable (Y) at some point t in time is — like “regular” linear regression — directly related to the predictor variable (X). Where simple linear regression and AR models differ is that Y is dependent on X and previous values for Y.
